You notice the wonderful white lacing and flavors of green mango, tangerine, resinous hops, orange blossom honey and subtle cracker notes. Before you know it, you\u2019re half way through your pint of Trustworthy IPA. The light malt body helps to really make the hops shine. The firm bitterness lets you know your drinking an IPA but it doesn\u2019t distract you from finishing your pint and wanting another one. Goes great with a burger and fries, Thai food, pasta, burritos, a good book, Friday nights and those awkward family parties."

You're left looking forward to the next sip and lookin\u2019 back at your glory days. Goes great with pizza, chicken wings, a light salad, mowing the lawn, fishin\u2019 by the lake and barstools."
